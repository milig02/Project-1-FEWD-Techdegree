      <h2>About me</h2>
      <p> After completing my degree in business marketing, I worked in an advertising agency.
        During my day-to-day, I got the chance to work closely with designers where
        I discovered how design & user experiences can be critical elements to a company's success and how fun it was to
        do.
        This is how I got hooked by this field and the reason why I have decided to pursue it.
